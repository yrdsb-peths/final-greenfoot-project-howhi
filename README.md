<h1><ins>Time to Play Connor’s Whac-A-Mole!<ins></h1>

Have you ever heard of the game *Whac-A-Mole*? Whether you have or haven’t, this is a great place for you to either start or improve your skills! 

My *Whac-A-Mole* consists of three *Worlds*. The first one is the TitleScreen world. This is the prelude to the game, where “Connor’s Whac-A-Mole” is listed on the screen for two seconds, and then the instructions to play the game show up, replacing the title “Connor’s Whac-A-Mole”. The user has an unlimited amount of time to read through the instructions before playing. If and when they decide to play, they must press <enter>, which would then lead the user to the next world: the MyWorld world (or as I like to refer to it a lot, the “GameWorld” world).

The user plays the game on the MyWorld world. Six identical “hidden moles” (they are hidden in their burrows) are placed in the world. They are hidden, so the user cannot click them. However, randomly, one of them will appear (be out of their hole and show). The user then has three seconds to click on this mole before it goes back to being a “hidden” mole. Every time a user clicks on one of these appearing moles before they become hidden, the score will increase by one and a “boing” sound will be heard as well as an animation of the mole going down will be shown, to indicate that the mole was clicked or “whacked”! One very annoying antagonist called Bugs Bunny is also part of this game. It, like the moles, will randomly show up in place of one of the moles. This bunny will show up for 2 seconds. If you click on it, it will say “Cut It Out!” and animate through a sort of “hammered” bunny animation where it kind of squashes in half (not gory). Clicking on this bunny also decreases the score by 3 points (score can be negative…).

The moles and bunny will always appear in a time frame between 0 and 5 seconds after one has been clicked or after one showed but didn’t clicked on. Levels are also in play here, too. For every 5 points, the level goes up, and the time it takes for a user to click a mole once it has appeared decreases by half a second.

The user must try to click on as many moles as they can within 90 seconds (one and a half minutes). Once the 90 seconds are up, the world is then set to the GameEndsWorld, the final world.

Here, the score that was obtained by the player is shown. The best score (high score) of the current session (since the last time the user pressed “Run” is also shown. And lastly, words on the screen will indicate that pressing <enter> will replay the game. 

Music will always be playing in the background during all three worlds. The TitleScreen and GameEndsWorld background and music are the same, while the MyWorld background and music will be different (music will also be lower in volume).

One quick final note: a constantly animating mole will also be showing on the TitleScreen and GameEndsWorld. This is mostly for appeal.
